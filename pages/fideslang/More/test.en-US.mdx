  Upgrade to the latest version (≥ 1.0.0) to use this feature.

  In most cases, you shouldn't directly _write_ to the cache, which might cause undefined behaviors of SWR. If you need to manually mutate a key, please consider using the SWR APIs.<br/>

By default, SWR uses a global cache to store and share data across all components. But you can also customize this behavior with the `provider` option of `SWRConfig`.

Cache providers are intended to enable SWR with more customized storages.

## Cache Provider

A cache provider is Map-like object which matches the following TypeScript definition (which can be imported from `swr`):

```typescript
interface Cache<Data> {
  get(key: string): Data | undefined
  set(key: string, value: Data): void
  delete(key: string): void
}
```
